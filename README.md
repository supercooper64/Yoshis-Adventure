# What's new in Version 2.0.3?

- Fixed a glitch where the player would not get hurt from the boss, Dratchy Downerhausen.

- Some music in select pages of the game (excluding the main game) are replaced to make it more Zelda/RPG-like. Additionally, new music is added.

- The non-playable Yoshis now have accurate dialogue, revealing the names of locations and other minor characters that were never revealed when the game first was launched, such as the boss now having a name, to be consistent with some other games.

- The echoing/multiple play sound glitch that was present earlier when the player attacks or does certain things are fixed.

- New sounds are added to the game, such as the ones from Baby Einstein's Baby Shakesphere when Yoshi receives items/keys, attacks enemies, or dies from losing too much HP, and the applause sound effect from Sesame Street when Yoshi wins the game.

# Differences from HTML5 Game

- The game's layout is changed and/or modified.

- Unlike HTML5 Game, Yoshi does carry a sword when fighting. Instead, he has powerups, as Yoshis do not carry swords in this game, as well as being less hostile.

- Music is changed to ones of DJ Studio's liking.

- When quitting the game, it functions like DJ STUDIO's other line of games, to be consistent.

- Rooms and areas are redesigned, especially the beginning of Fey Forest.

- There are Yoshi voice clips (only used on Yoshi himself).

- The original hero of the game is now the kidnappee, likely to avoid plagorism, as Yoshi now takes her place.

- The original game's NPCs are replaced with blue, red and purple Yoshis, referencing the different colored Links in the Zelda line of games (the enemies are not changed).

- Music now changes when going to the boss, rather than being the same Forest theme for that area.

- The boss door is locked, not allowing Yoshi to go outside of the room.

- Sound effects are added for enemies, obtaining items, and menus.

- In the shop section, potion names and item names are changed to better suit the game.

- Yabe Yoscheinwald (a legal children's parody of Rachel Dratch's SNL character, Abe Scheinwald) acts as a companion in the game. He replaces HTML5 game's character, Calvin, in the scenes where the other Yoshis are shown. 

- Dialogue is changed or added, similar to The Wizarding World of Yoshis.

- There is a seperate boss room that Zora is placed in. However, like some areas, it requires a key to get in.

- Star Wars franchise: The word, "May Yoshyrule Be With You!", is a reference to this franchises's "May the Force Be With You" phrase.

- Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time: Yoshi's sprites are reused from this game, with the exception of Blue, Red and Purple Yoshi, which are completely repainted by DJ STUDIO due to the lack of frames for them in regards to turning their view when Yoshi "looks" at the NPC Yoshis, although Purple Yoshi was an original paint job after the game did not have that colored Yoshi.

- Parks and Recreation (TV Show): The place, Swanson Sewers, is a name parodied reference to the character Ron Swanson. Leslie Knope is mentioned in this game by Blue Yoshi in the beginning of the game. Also, in the description for the powerup, "Super Saiyan Yoshi", Tom Haverford's "Treat Yo Self" catchphrase is referenced.

- Dragon Ball Z: The powerup name, Super Saiyan Yoshi, is a reference to the famous word, "Super Saiyan".

- Will and Grace: The boss who kidnaps Zora who has the last name Downerhausen is a name parody of Anastasia Beaverhausen's (the alter ego of Karen Walker) last name.

- Saturday Night Live: There are many references to this legendary NBC show. For example, Yoshi (as well as his buddies) visit places such as Fey Forest (where the game starts), Gasteyer Garden (Yabe's favorite area, according to him), and Mulaney Madlands (the castle area where Downerhausen and his many minions are found). Turns out, these places are name references to actresses, Ana Gasteyer, Tina Fey, and SNL writer/actor John Mulaney. Also the antagonist's name, Dratchy Downerhausen, are references to the character, Debbie Downer, from a recurring SNL skit (the character is also mentioned by Yoshneese during the beginning of the game and when Yoehler Poehleberg apologizes for "being one", during the middle of the game when he gets mad about the Zombie Scourage occuring), as well as the actress herself, Rachel Dratch. Fey Forest's setting, as well as the powerup name, "Furious Falconer", are partial references to the recurring Will Forte sketch, The Falconer. The "real names" for Red Yoshi, Blue Yoshi and Purple Yoshi, "Yoshneese", "Yabe Yoscheinwald", and "Yoehler Poehlerberg", are name parodies of Amy Poehler and Andy Samberg's last names, Kristen Wiig's character, Dooneese, and Rachel Dratch's character, Abe Scheinwald, respectively. The potion name, "Schweddy's Potion", is a reference to Alec Baldwin's Pete Schweddy, who debuted in the infamous SNL Delicious Dish sketch, "Schweddy Balls".

# Did You Know?:

- This is the first game to star Yoshi as a protagonist.

- This is the only game where Yoshi has voice clips, but the NPCs that he talks to do not.

- Unlike the main character, the colored Yoshis seen in this game have real names that are name parodies of SNL characters/celebrities.

- Some of these mechanics, such as the addition of Yabe Yoscheinwald as a "Tutorial Yoshi", were later reused or based on in The Wizarding World of Yoshis, the second DJ STUDIO-developed, non-Nintendo licensed game to star Yoshi.

# Pre-release/Unused Content

- Blue Yoshi was supposed to be Yellow Yoshi, but was not added due to the Photoshop paint editor rendering the color incorrect. This also was the case for Black and Pink Yoshi, who were replaced with Purple and Red Yoshi in the final.

- The game had different sound effects.

- Sarah was supposed to be the name for Zora. However, it was changed to avoid confusion with some people that are named that.

- Prior to Version 2.0.3, the monster had no name. However, two names were planned: Poehlerberg (parody of Amy Poehler and Andy Samberg's last names) and Ghastly Gemini (name parodied reference to the SNL skit, Gemini's Twin), before being called Dratchy Downerhausen in the final, with the Poehler/Samberg name parody being merged as Purple Yoshi's "real" name in the final.
