# Yoshi's Adventure Game (ROM HACK OF HTML5 Game)
A Zelda-ish Adventure Game starring Yoshi, and the ROM hack of HTML5 Game.

# Differences from HTML5 Game
-The game's layout is changed and/or modified.

-Unlike HTML5 Game, Yoshi does carry a sword when fighting. Instead, he has powerups, as Yoshis do not carry swords. The karate moves likely reference Alex Egelston.

-Music is changed to DJ Studio's liking.

-When quitting the game, it functions like DJ STUDIO's other line of games, to be consistent.
-There are Yoshi voice clips.

-The original hero of the game is now the kidnappee, likely to avoid plagorism, as Yoshi now takes her place.

-The original game's NPCs are replaced with blue, red and purple Yoshis, referencing the different colored LInks in the Zelda line of games (the enemies are not changed).

-Music now changes when going to the Ruins, Sewers and the Boss, rather than being the same Forest theme.
-Sound effects are added for enemies, obtaining items, and menus.

-In the shop section, potion names and item names are changed to better suit the game.

-Tutorial Yoshi is now in the game.

-Dialogue is changed or added.
