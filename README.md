# Yoshi's Adventure Game (ROM HACK OF HTML5 Game)
A Zelda-ish Adventure Game starring Yoshi, and the ROM hack of HTML5 Game, featuring music
from Xuanyuan Jian Canwaizhuan:, Treasure Hunter G, Star Wars Episode VII: A New Hope, Romancing Saga 2 and Mamorukun Curse.

# Differences from HTML5 Game
- The game's layout is changed and/or modified.

- Unlike HTML5 Game, Yoshi does carry a sword when fighting. Instead, he has powerups, as Yoshis do not carry swords. The karate moves likely reference Alex Egelston.

- Music is changed to ones of DJ Studio's liking.

- When quitting the game, it functions like DJ STUDIO's other line of games, to be consistent.

- There are Yoshi voice clips.

- The original hero of the game is now the kidnappee, likely to avoid plagorism, as Yoshi now takes her place.

- The original game's NPCs are replaced with blue, red and purple Yoshis, referencing the different colored Links in the Zelda line of games (the enemies are not changed).

- Music now changes when going to the boss, rather than being the same Forest theme for that level.

- The boss door is locked.

- Sound effects are added for enemies, obtaining items, and menus.

- In the shop section, potion names and item names are changed to better suit the game.

- Tutorial Yoshi is now in the game.

- Dialogue is changed or added, similar to The Wizarding World of Yoshis.
